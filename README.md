## Contributing to this repository
### Committing to ```master```
Please avoid directly committing to the master branch.
Remember, ```master``` is meant to be stable, unlike things such as the Byte.IT subsite when under development. 
If you have to add a feature, create a new branch for it and make a pull request to merge to master.

#### Committing directly to ```master``` is acceptable if and only if one of the following cases arises:
- Adding a member or modifying a member info.
- Updating ```.gitignore```
- Updating ```README.md```
- Only changing text without affecting any HTML classes or CSS properties or any JS code.

### Commits
Please try to keep your commits clean, short and in the past tense, clearly describing what you did. This can be considered as an example of a good commit: ```Added member John Doe```.

### Pull Requests
Please only make pull requests once the features you were working on are totally stable and free of any errors. Nobody likes errors, after all... No pull requests should be merged unless reviewed by any of the following:

- Byte President
- Byte Vice President
- Byte Former President
- Byte Former Vice President

Any pull request merged without review shall be reverted and re-opened for code review.

### Conventions
Please try to follow these conventions when you write code.
- Indent using tabs with a tab width of 4.
- Camelcase variable names for JavaScript (for example ```myLongVariableName```)
- Lowercase variable names with underscore between words for all other languages (for example ```my_long_variable_name```)
- HTML class and ID names should be descriptive and self-explanatory.

### The System Folder
Please do not make **ANY** changes to the system folder of CodeIgniter for **ANY** reason.

### Features
If you're working on a feature, please create an issue for it on GitHub and assign yourself. Every commit related to that issue must have the number mentioned with an octothorpe (#). If you'd like to have a feature but you won't prefer to work on it, please create the issue without assigning yourself.
