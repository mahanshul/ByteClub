	<h2>Online Learning Sessions</h2>
	<h3>by Byte Club</h3>
	<p>
		<b>Note:</b> This is only for the students of Bal Bharati Public School, Pitampura. Our inter-school event is Byte.IT.
	</p>
	<p>
		Considering the current situation, we at Byte Club genuinely hope that you are safe. Staying at home can be boring, and we'd like to help you learn digital skills such as programming, graphic design, computer security and web development.
	</p>
	<p>
		We plan to build a community where we can help each other learn and share resources. We will organize online learning sessions for classes 11 and 12 every Friday where Byte Club members will guide you and answer your questions.
	</p>
	<p>
		After our class, you will be assigned a small task to work on. We may induct new members in the club based on your performance in these tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Stay tuned for more updates!
